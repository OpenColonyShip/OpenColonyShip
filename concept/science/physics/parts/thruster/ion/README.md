Ion Thruster Formula:

<<<<<<< HEAD
F = 2*η*P/(g * I<sub>sp</sub>), where

* F is the thrust (force) in N,
* η is the efficiency, a dimensionless value between 0 and 1 (70% efficiency is 0.7),
* P is the electrical power energy going into the thruster in W,
* g is a constant, the acceleration due to gravity 9.81 m/s2,
* I<sub>sp</sub> is the specific impulse in s.
