Ion Thruster Formula:

 F = 2*η*P/(g * I<sub>sp</sub>)
 Where

 F is the thrust (force) in N,
 η is the efficiency, a dimensionless value between 0 and 1 (70% efficiency is 0.7),
 P is the electrical power energy going into the thruster in W,
 g is a constant, the acceleration due to gravity 9.81 m/s2,
 I<sub>sp</sub> is the specific impulse in s.
