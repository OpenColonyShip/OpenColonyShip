# Chameara
Chamearae are blueish blobs that can reshape into any form that originated on a watery moon. They are about 1m^3. They are very curious. They left for exploratory purposes.

They consist of a nucleus from which tendrils fan out. All of this is encased in a watery blueish gel.

They reproduce asexually, via fission. They first grow a second nucleus, which then develops its own tendrils. Then the Chameara splits down the middle, severing the connection and completing the process.
