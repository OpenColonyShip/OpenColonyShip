# Ancient One
The Ancient Ones were a species that existed long before the others. They developed galaxy-wide automated factories, before dying out suddenly. They built the factory that built the Mechanicals, they built the automatic gas-extraction system that gave solid surfaces to the Drifters, and they left ruins around the Local Cluster for you to find.

They developed quickly as they invented Von Neumann machines early on. They developed machines that repaired their bodies, making them functionally immortal. They quickly lost the need to reproduce and soon became incapable. However, when the Parasites evolved, they were not adapted to the threat. Now only very few spaceships are populated with them. Their Von Neumann machines still exist and merely wait for orders.
