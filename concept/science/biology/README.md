# Playable Species

## Human
Humans are bipedal lifeforms from Earth. They left Earth due to a war.

## Drifter
Drifters are giant pink/purple gas-bags from a gas giant. They left due to their star turning into a white dwarf. They only developed any technology because an ancient gas-giant extraction system chose their planet, giving them a solid surface for the first time.

## Chameara
Chamearae are blueish blobs that can reshape into any form that originated on a watery moon. They are about 1m^3. They are very curious. They left for exploratory purposes.

## Decapod
Decapods are orange-haired, 10-legged hivemind creatures from a rocky planet. They left to expand their hive to other planets.

## Child of the Void
The (deep blue) Children of the Void used to live near to a black hole until their planet got dangerously close and they were forced to leave.
The survivors are now endlessly exploring the most dangerous areas of space.

## Mechanical *
The Mechanicals are sentient orange/blue plated robots that were produced in the final shutdown sequence of a malfunctioning factory built by an ancient species. They are very rare as not many were built. The factory imploded soon after their creation, leaving only dust.

## Industrial *
The Industrials are orange 17-legged creatures that use steampunk themed equipment. Their computers are made entirely from clockwork. They left their home planet by accident on a very fast spaceship with slow steering.

## Parasite *
The Parasites are small beetle-like beings that can hibernate for a very long time. They form hivemind-controlled groups and infest other species' spaceships, consuming their resources. They have been in existence for at least as long as the Ancient Ones, who initially spread them from planet to planet. The Ancient Ones treat them as pets.

# Non-Playable Species

## Ancient One *
The Ancient Ones were a species that existed long before the others. They developed galaxy-wide automated factories, before dying out suddenly. They built the factory that built the Mechanicals, they built the automatic gas-extraction system that gave solid surfaces to the Drifters, and they left ruins around the Local Cluster for you to find.

# Non-Sentient Environment Species
Non-Sentient Environment species are those that are not brought along by the player or NPC spaceships. They could be found on planets, Ancient One biospheres, or floating in space itself. They all have ecosystems so one species is rarely found on its own.

# Non-Sentient Ship Species
Non-Sentient Ship species consist of two main categories. The actual species are documented within the folder for the species that owns the spaceship on which the species live.

## Plants
Plants are brought along either to preserve their existence or for food. A Human example is wheat.

## Animals

### Livestock
Livestock is brought along for food. A Human example is the cow.

### Pets
Pets are brought along for company or to preserve their existence. They are only eaten in times of great hardship. A Human example is the dog.
