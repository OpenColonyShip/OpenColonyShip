# Playable Species

## Human
Humans are bipedal lifeforms from Earth. They left Earth due to a war.

## Drifter
Drifters are giant gas-bags from a gas giant. They left due to their star turning into a white dwarf.

## Chameara
Chamearae are blobs that can reshape into any form that originated on a watery moon. They are about 1m^3. They are very curious. They left for exploratory purposes.

## Decapod
Decapods are 10-legged hivemind creatures from a rocky planet. They left to expand their hive to other planets.

## Children of the Void
The Children of the Void used to live near to a black hole until their planet got dangerously close and they were forced to leave.
The survivors are now endlessly exploring the most dangerous areas of space.

## Mechanical (name change?)
The Mechanicals are sentient networked robots that were produced in the final shutdown sequence of a malfunctioning factory built by an ancient species. They are very rare as not many were built. The factory imploded soon after their creation, leaving only dust.

# Non-Playable Species

Non-Playable Species consist of two main categories. The actual species are documented within the folder for the species that owns the spaceship on which the species live.

## Plants

Plants are brought along either to preserve their existence or for food. A Human example is wheat.

## Animals

### Livestock

Livestock is brought along for food. A Human example is the cow.

### Pets

Livestock is brought along for company or to preserve their existence. They are only eaten in times of great hardship. A Human example is the dog.
