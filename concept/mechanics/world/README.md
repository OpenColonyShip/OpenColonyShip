# The World
The world is an area containing galaxies. It makes up the [Local Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Group).

There is no need to have anything outside of this group as they will never be reachable.

We will artificially introduce resources into the environment and tweak the physics a little such that roughly the same world is maintained at all times. This is so that the player does not run out of world.
