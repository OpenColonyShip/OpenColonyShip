#Intro

This is the folder where Sam is planning on making a test JavaScript game engine. It may not get used. Anyway, please don't delete this!

## Hello by Microlith57

OK, Sam. Engines go under [development](https://github.com/OpenColonyShip/OpenColonyShip/tree/master/development). Please move this stuff, and read development/README.md
